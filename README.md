#  Bytecat - UNHM Advising Chatbot

## What is This Project?
The **Bytecat - UNHM Advising Chatbot** is a helpful tool for graduate students at the University of New Hampshire (UNH).  
It can answer questions about:
- **Courses** ‚Äì like descriptions, prerequisites, and credits.
- **Orientation** ‚Äì such as deadlines, policies, contacts, and where to find resources.

It uses powerful AI (OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo) to give smart and helpful answers in a conversation style.

---

## System Architecture (Step-by-Step Flow)

Here‚Äôs how the Bytecat - UNHM Advising chatbot works behind the scenes:

### 1. Data Ingestion
- **PDF Documents** (like course catalogs and orientation guides) are added to the system.
- The PDFs go through **PDF Processing** to extract **text and tables**.

### 2. Preprocessing
- The extracted text is **chunked** into smaller, manageable pieces.
- These chunks are converted into **embeddings** using `text-embedding-ada-002` from OpenAI.
- The embeddings are stored in a **Chroma Vector Store** for fast retrieval.

### 3. When a User Asks a Question
- The chatbot first **checks if the same question was asked before** using the **chat history or cache**.

  - **If found in cache:** It returns the **cached response**.
  - **If not found in cache:** It does a **semantic search** in the Chroma database to find relevant chunks.

### 4. Answer Generation
- It uses the matching chunks to create a **contextual prompt**.
- That prompt is sent to **OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo**, which generates a **smart and conversational reply**.

### 5. Memory & Response
- The response is **saved in the chat history** for future use (context + caching).
- Finally, the **answer is returned to the user**.
